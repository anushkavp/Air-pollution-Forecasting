# Air-pollution-Forecasting
Time Series Project

This time series project aims to predict the air pollution which is calculated in PM2.5 units.

The data is from Beijing China collected every hour from 2010 to 2015.

It has several other parameters too in play such as, the temperature, pressure, dew etc.

To run this file, just run "Beijing_air_pollution_timeseries_project.py". This file internally uses "toolset.py" which contains helper or utility time series related functions that help run the main file.

** Takes about 10 mins to run the python file
